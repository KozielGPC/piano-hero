# Piano Hero

### About
Piano Hero is a rhythm based game like the Guitar Hero, but for Piano. It is still under development, so may occur some bugs.

### Play
It's deployed on Vercel. You can play online clicking [here](https://kozi-piano-hero.vercel.app/)


### Technologies
For this application, I've used mainly React.Js, styled with Material UI, and [Fabric.Js](https://fabricjs.com/) for Canvas management, animation control and collision detection.
